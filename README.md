Collaborators: Asher Lachoff, Jennifer Honeywell

Visualization of data collected by Jennifer as part of another project. The visualization is based on the streamgraph transitions template created by Mike Bostock. Most of the work we did on this project was accomplished in discord calls where both members worked out problems together by screensharing.
